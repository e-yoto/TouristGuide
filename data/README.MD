# README #

## General structure ##

* `doc` is for documentation, report, etc. Create a folder for your team there, e.g., `teamX`, and initialize the report document there.
* `src` is for anything source-related for your project.
* `lib` is a folder for storing the different libraries (e.g, .jar files, etc. ) used in your team project.
* `data` is any sample data set  *legally obtained*, *less than 2GB* (bitbucket limit), *does not contain PII, malware, any other illegal or explicit content*. Otherwise, keep your data set separately locally elsewhere. Examples of data set: images, XML files, SQLite database files for testing, JSON documents, etc.
* `NetBeansProjects` is a folder where you must put NetBeans  projects you are using for various testing purposes. You can write plain Java applications to test the API(s) you planed to use in your team project.

## Documents to Write ##

* **LaTeX  or Markdown are required to be used. **
* Create a subfolder named `tasks` in the `doc` folder and put your project plan there. Please don't use MS Excel or MS Project. User Markdown (MD) instead. Take a look at this [tutorial](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents) for creating a task list using MD.
